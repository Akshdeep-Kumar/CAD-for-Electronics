# CAD for Electronics

## Overview
This repository contains all the necessary files for the "CAD for Electronics" course, comprising 16 different experiments. Each experiment is designed to help students understand and apply various concepts in electronic design using CAD tools.

## Contents
- **All Experiment Files**: This folder contains all the experiment files required for the course.
- **Manual.pdf**: A comprehensive manual that provides detailed instructions and theoretical background for each experiment.

## Software Requirements
The following software is required to work with the experiments provided in this repository:
- **PSpice**: Used for circuit simulation. Required for experiments involving simulation.
- **Other CAD Tools**: Depending on the specific requirements of each experiment, additional CAD software may be required. Please refer to the Manual.pdf for specific software needs per experiment.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akshdeep-Kumar/CAD-for-Electronics.git
   ```
2. **Download and Install Required Software**:
   Ensure that you have the necessary software installed on your machine as listed under the Software Requirements section.

3. **Prepare Experiment Files**:
   Navigate to the "All Experiment Files" folder and review the files for each experiment.

4. **Modify PSpice Experiments**:
   In experiments that require PSpice simulations, replace the placeholder `<model definition here>` with the content from the `tsmc180.txt` file located inside the "All Experiment Files" folder.

## Usage
Refer to the **Manual.pdf** for detailed instructions on how to proceed with each experiment. The manual includes step-by-step guides and necessary theoretical information to support the practical activities.
